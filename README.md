# CarScout

Project Overview:
Car maintenance is essential for the longevity and optimal performance of vehicles, but finding a reliable mechanic can be challenging. This problem is further intensified in emergency situations where immediate assistance is required. Our app aims to provide a solution to this problem by connecting users with on-spot mechanics and enabling them to schedule vehicle maintenance and service with just a few clicks. The methodology employed involves developing a user-friendly mobile application with distinct panels for customers, mechanics, workshop owners, and a website for admin. The app integrates various APIs such as Google Maps, Firebase, and Twilio to enable real-time tracking, verification, and communication. The benefits of this app include efficient and reliable car maintenance services, enhanced customer experience, and improved communication and transparency among stakeholders. In conclusion, our app aims to revolutionize the car maintenance industry by providing a hassle-free and convenient solution for users and bridging the gap between customers and mechanics.

Project Scope:
Vehicles need maintenance and servicing at least once a year to keep them running smoothly and hassle-free and to check that their critical components like brakes and suspensions are working properly. But most owners procrastinate due to a lot of different issues, as a result of which sometimes they get stuck on the road because their car or bike suddenly ceases working.
So, this project is to facilitate people in both ways. By providing them mechanics if their automobile stops working in the middle of their journey and scheduling for servicing of their automobiles. Also, our aim is to help mechanics as well in their earning. The scope of this project includes and excludes the following:

In scope:
●	 Customers can use it for the entire 24 hours.
●	Whenever a customer wants help in an emergency situation, an alert will be generated, and the workshop owner will ask the mechanic to go for it.
●	The mechanics will be charging for the route as well.
●	This app will initially be used in certain areas.
●	For scheduling, customers will have a choice of either taking their automobile to the workshop by themselves or calling the mechanic to take their automobile for service. Charges will be applicable according to the facility.
●	Workshop owners as well as customers can track mechanics.
●	We will market our product.

Out of scope:
•	Changes in deadline. 
•	Unplanned work.
•	Physical car repairs, including paint, bodywork, and major mechanical work
•	Provision of car parts or components
•	Liability for the quality of work or service provided by mechanics or garages
